# Must-haves

*   Measurement horizontal offsets follow time folding rules.
*   Ruler rendering and labels/marks follow time folding rules, too.
*   Multiple folding ranges selected via `write_svg` and maybe even auto-paired folds (blocks?)
    with "collapsed/open" flags in the DSL code.
*   Labels on folds.
*   Automatic (variable) spacing of channels to allow stacking of any number of measurements
    in "ruts".


# Wish-list

*   Option to do "outer arrow" on very narrow measurements.
*   *Variable* fold widths.
*   Dotted lines joining each edge of **every** channel waveform.
*   Measure frequency.
*   Add time range option to "each_sample", esp. so it can be used for "replay"
    (e.g. auto calculating logical operations while laying down an extra channel) and
    zoom, with leadin/out.
*   "Cleanse" stuff that is compressed inside a fold.
*   Offsets/nudge for text stuff so it can avoid folds.
*   "Wiggly" folds? Either one long sinusoid, or wavy lines.
