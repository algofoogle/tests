; Description::
;
;   Some work towards reading data from the Flash Program Memory and writing it
;   out via SPI. Also demonstrates use of the Z pointer (`r30:r31`) for a jump
;   table, and more macro goodness.
;
;   **THIS EXAMPLE ISN'T YET FINISHED...**

; Burning info::
;
; ***    LOW fuse byte:  0x6A
; ***    HIGH fuse byte: 0xFF
; ***    EEPROM:         Not used

; Interrupt table starts at 0x0000. ATtiny13A has 10 interrupt vectors (inc. RESET):
.org 0x0000
firmware_top:
; Reset vector comes first:
    rjmp main
; The other 9 interrupts all just return without doing anything, at the moment:
    reti                ; Interrupt Vector 2   = EXT_INT0   (External Interrupt Request 0)
    reti                ; Interrupt Vector 3   = PCINT0     (Pin Change)

    reti                ; Interrupt Vector 5   = EE_RDY     (EEPROM Ready)
    reti                ; Interrupt Vector 6   = ANA_COMP   (Analog Comparator)
    rjmp timer_isr      ; Interrupt Vector 7   = TIM0_COMPA (Timer Compare Match A)
    reti                ; Interrupt Vector 8   = TIM0_COMPB (Timer Compare Match B)
    reti                ; Interrupt Vector 9   = WDT        (Watchdog Timeout)
    reti                ; Interrupt Vector 10  = ADC        (ADC Conversion Complete)


; Main program:
main:
    ; I've determined that an OSCCAL value of 0x6E gives the best approximation
    ; of 9.6MHz on my ATtiny13A.
    slide_osccal 0x6E

    ; Make the CPU clock run at full speed:
    disable_clock_prescaler

    init_stack

    ; Set all pins to be outputs:
    ser r16                 ; R16 <- 0xFF
    out DDRB, r16
    nop                     ; Synchronise.

    ; Set up PB0 to initially output a high value:
    sbi PORTB, PB0

    ; Set up PB1 to initially output a low value:
    cbi PORTB, PB1

    ; Set up the Z (16-bit) pointer to point to the _timer_isr_jumps table.
    ; As timer_isr fires each time, this Z pointer gets incremented to jump to the next
    ; point in the jump table, for directing execution according to each of
    ; 7 stages in the 14ms cycle:
    clr ZH
    ldi ZL, pm_lo8(_timer_isr_jumps)
    ; NOTE: We're assuming all of the jump table is below the 256th program
    ; memory address in this firmware. If it wasn't, we'd have to use ZH
    ; too, which means instructions to handle rolling over ZL into ZH
    ; as we update the Z pointer per each ISR hit.

    ; Configure timer to generate an interrupt every 2ms...
    ; That is, after 75/(CLK/256) seconds =>
    ;   75/(9,600,000/256) = 0.002 = 2ms
    ;
    init_simple_timer clk_256, 75

sleep_loop:
    ; Enable "Idle" sleep mode:
    enable_sleep
    ; Sleep -- basically, halt the CPU and let interrupts fire when required:
    sleep
    ; I think we get here when a RETI occurs from within an ISR.
    rjmp sleep_loop
    
; This is an ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) that handles TIM0_COMPA
; (i.e. interrupt generated when when Timer/Counter 0 hits a given limit
; in OCR0A). This is currently configured to fire every 2ms.
; 
; This ISR uses the Z pointer with a jump table to jump to the stage it
; currently needs to process. After that, it increments (or resets) the
; Z pointer as required. These are the events that happen at specific
; times in the cycle:
;
;   *   After 2ms (1 interrupt), while PB0 is high, we want to do some
;       proof-of-concept "work".
;   *   After 10ms (4 more interrupts), we want to pull PB0 low.
;   *   After 14ms (2 more interrupts), we want to pull PB0 high again
;       and reset the interrupt counter.
;
; For the time while we're NOT in this ISR, the main program is just in SLEEP
; mode, so the MCU is idling. We COULD potentially do other work during this
; time but I have nothing for it to do at the moment.
;

    ; Jump to whichever point in the jump table is currently indicated by
    ; the Z pointer. The landing address represents a stage of the 7

_timer_isr_jumps:
    ; This is a jump table. Depending on how many times the interrupt has
    ; fired already, the IJMP above will land on one of these 7 slots --
    ; -- the 7th will reset the Z pointer to the start of the jump table.
    ; Note that each RJMP here adds 2 cycles to the ISR lead-in time:
                                ; 2 cycles each...
    rjmp _timer_isr_act_toggle  ; 1st interrupt (2ms passed): PB1 -> high.

    rjmp _timer_isr_do_work     ; 4th interrupt (8ms passed): Do some work.
    rjmp _timer_isr_10ms        ; 5th interrupt (10ms passed): pull PB0 low.

_timer_isr_act_toggle:
    ; When PB1 is not being used as the DATA channel in _timer_isr_do_work,
    ; it is being driven high for a period of 4ms out of 14ms. This is so it
    ; can drive an indicator LED, which shows that we're alive and kicking.

    ; 2ms mark to turn the LED on, and once again at 6ms to turn it off.

_timer_isr_do_work:
    ; 2ms has elapsed...

    ; This routine reads a sequence of 8 bytes from within the Flash ROM
    ; Program Memory of the MCU, and writes each bit of each
    ; byte out -- MSB first -- using a 200kHz SPI approach.
    ; That is, each bit is clocked at 5us intervals. There is a gap
    ; of 20us between the LSB of one byte, and the MSB of the next.
    ; If you add that all up:
    ;   (8 bits * 5us + 20us) * 8 bytes
    ;   => The cycle is complete in 480us.

    ; Push Z onto the stack, because we need to mess with it here...
    push ZL
    push ZH     ; NOTE: We could leave this out, and just
                ; assume that ZH will stay at 0, always, or
                ; at least verify that it *starts* at 0 before
                ; the loop, and then reset it to 0 after the
                ; loop is done (i.e. "clr ZH" instead of "pop ZH").
                ; This would shave at least 2 instructions,
                ; and save 1 byte of stack (SRAM).
                ; IN FACT, we know what the next step will be
                ; in the jump table, so we could load its address
                ; directly and even do away with the PUSH/POP
                ; instructions completely:
                ; * Delete 2xPUSH
                ; * Delete "LDI ZH"
                ; * Change final 2xPOP to 2xLDI.
                ; ...which will save 3 instructions.
    ; Now point Z to the data bytes (using BYTE addresses)
    ; that we have in Program Memory:
    ldi ZL, lo8(data)
    ldi ZH, hi8(data)

    ; (3 since commencing the SBI or CBI instruction).
    ; We want to hold the PB1 (last output bit) state for 5us
    ; (48 cycles, minus the overhead built in to each iteration of the loop):
    ;   RequiredDelay = 48 - LoopHead - LoopTail
    ;   = 48 - 6 - 3
    ;   = 39 cycles we need to pad out:
    precise_delay 12, 1             ; 3*(12+1)*1 = 39 cycles.

    ; output. From cycle counting, we can tell that from the moment
    ; PB1 drops low again (at this next instruction), there are 11 cycles
    ; of overhead before the first bit of the NEXT byte can be output,
