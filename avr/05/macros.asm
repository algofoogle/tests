; This macro executes a delay measured in SIXTEENTHS OF A MILLISECOND
; (assuming that the system clock is 9.6MHz). It is called like this:
;   short_delay 160, r16, r17
; ...which would mean a delay of 10 millisecond (i.e. 160 x 1/16 = 10),
; and it uses registers r16 and r17 for its inner (A) and outer (B) loops,
; internally. The last 2 arguments are optional; they default to
; r16 and r17 if not specified.
;
; The minimum delay is "1", which is 1/16000 of a second.
; The maximum delay is "0", which is 256/16000 of a second => 16ms.
;
; I haven't implemented this as a subroutine: Calling it as a subroutine
; wouldn't save much over its current in-line size.

; This is the same as short_delay, except it allows you to finely tune
; exactly how many cycles it will waste, by supplying values for
; both the inner and outer loops, such that the exact delay is:
; 	delay = (3*ticks_b*(ticks_a + 1) / 9600) milliseconds
; Examples:
;	; (3*16*200)/9600 => 1 millisecond:
; 		precise_delay 199, 16
;		; 6 instructions.
;	; Two cycles short of exactly 10 milliseconds:
;		precise_delay 134, 237	; 3*237*135 => 95985 cycles.
;		precise_delay   1, 2	; 3*2*2 => 12 cycles.
;		nop						; 1 cycle.
;		; SUM: 95,998 cycles => 2 less than 96,000.
;		; 13 instructions.
; NOTE: If ticks_a or ticks_b is 0, it's equivalent to 256.
; Examples:
;	precise_delay 1, 1		; Shortest possible delay: 3*1*2/9600 => 0.625us
